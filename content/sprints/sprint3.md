    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>This sprint, I tried to leave as much of the user stories + acceptance criteria to the product owner as I could.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the ACs did not make sense or the story was incomplete so I sat down with the PO and we refined the stories.</p>
        <p>
            Here is a story I believe is decomposed nicely and has a well written acceptance criteria:

        <p>Since the last sprint, my use of GIT has not gotten better or worse</p>
        <p>
            I used code comments on the PRs I had to review and gave thorough feedback. I also requested changes when I felt it was necessary
            <img src="/images/sprint3_code_pr_comments.png"/>
            <img src="/images/sprint3_change_requested.png">
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed the correct naming conventions for both branches and PRs, and I made my stories on their own branches.
            I also added labels to my PRs to sort them nicely.

        </p>
        <p>
            I made a whole bunch of commits. My philosophy is "1 change = 1 commit". The reason why is simple: easier cherry-pick, reset, readability. And since we squash before merging, it won't make a big glob of commits on the master branch

<rubric-section :name="'Test Driven Development'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>I used TDD to the best of my capabilities</p>
        <p>
            I always wrote my tests before the implementation (see below image for proof)
            <img src="/images/sprint3_tests_first_impl_later.png"/>
            <img src="/images/sprint3_tests_first_impl_later_2.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            All of my stories have in-depth tests associated with them. You can check any of my PRs and see that I have more lines of test than code (see below image for proof)
            <img src="/images/sprint3_more_tests_than_code.png" />
            <img src="/images/sprint3_more_tests_than_code_2.png" />
            That's a total of <strong>739</strong> changes related to tests. The whole branch has <strong>976 added</strong> and <strong>274 removed</strong>.

<rubric-section :name="'Code'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>My code meets the criteria put forth in the story's acceptance criteria. This is how I know what to write and when to merge. I always base myself on the AC</p>
        <p>This sprint, I did not need to choose any data-structures or anything like that for me stories so I cannot say much about how "judicious" I was in regards to that</p>
        <p>I did not i18n my stories </p>
        <p>
            I am 100% certain that the database compiles with the data model as I have extensive persistence tests which rely on FlyWay to migrate in-order to pass PLUS manual tests
            <img src="/images/sprint3_persistence_tests.png"/>
            267 lines of persistence test, most of which are written by me for my stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am certain that the data I handle is sync'd because of my tests and also because I rely on a reliable library, FlyWay, to migrate the database rather than just writing SQL scripts and running them on startup.
            <img src="/images/sprint3_db_migrations.png"/>
        </p>
        <p>I ensured optimization of DB queries by using the JPABuddy plugin on IntelliJ</p>

<rubric-section :name="'Security'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
            <p>This sprint I added login so security was a big portion of the sprint.</p>
            <p>Firstly, I use SpringSecurity to manage authentication & authorization. SpringSecurity is a big and reliable library.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I use JWT to manage authentication. JWT is quite secure, though not as secure as sessions. A tradeoff between security and performance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I did extensive research about JWT. Recall that I gave a presentation about it to both classes.</p>
            <p>One thing I will note though is that the token should really be stored in an <code>http-only</code>, but due to limitations with APIG, I could not do that.</p>
            <p>
                Currently, the token is stored in the local storage, which is more prone to XSS attacks.<br>
                This <a class="link link-secondary" href="https://dzone.com/articles/cookies-vs-tokens-the-definitive-guide">article</a> explains why.
            </p>
        <p>
            I used DTOs where I felt it was necessary to prevent sensitive data from leaving the internal system.

        <p>
            Unfortunately, we did not get time to implement UUIDs as I would have wanted.<br>
            Here I am going to ask you to cut me some slack.<br>
            I brought up <strong>two</strong> services by lonesome.<br>
            Whole teams had trouble maintaining <strong>one</strong>.<br>

<rubric-section :name="'Reviews'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>I reviewed code as best as I could and ensured my code was reviewed properly by checking in with the reviewers</p>
        <p>When I spotted suspicious code, I pulled and tested locally then checked the JaCoCo report</p>
        <p>
            I added code comments & I started using code comments and asking questions (as opposed to giving commands as per Jason's instructions).
            <img src="/images/sprint2_pull_138_code_comments_example.png" />
        </p>
        <p>I ensured that my reviewers actually reviewed my code by asking questions about it in person after they had reviewed it</p>
        <p>I kept a close eye on the naming of the PRs I reviewed (branch & PR name)</p>

<rubric-section :name="'E2E Tests'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>Selenium testing was a bit off for our service.</p>
        <p>
            Unbeknownst to me, my <strong>teammates</strong> wrote tests for <strong>my</strong> stories.<br>
            When I asked them why, they said because that was the only thing they could contribute.<br>
            I felt bad so I did not remove their Selenium tests even though they should've (rightfully) been written by me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a screenshot of how I <strong>would have</strong> written the tests (wherever there is a orange or green on the left bar, that means I have changed it)
            <img src="/images/sprint3_selenium_what_if.png" />
            Here my teammates made a couple of fatal mistakes.<br>
            Firstly, too many <code class="text-gray-900">Thread.sleep</code><br>
            This causes the tests to be slow.<br>
            Instead, we should opt for <code class="text-gray-900">WebDriverWait</code><br>
            This sped up the tests exponentially.<br>
            Secondly, there was no actual testing of the error message.<br>
            Just that the button was clicked...<br>

<rubric-section :name="'Deployment'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>I am 100% sure that my story can be deployed through the CI/CD pipelines we have set-up.</p>
        <p>To my knowledge, we did not deploy anything nor were we asked to so I cannot really speak on this for this sprint.</p>

<rubric-section :name="'Scrum Roles'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>Although it was my turn, I did not have a special scrum role</p>
        <p>The reason is simple: special role == half load, meaning that some critical aspects of AUTH (i.e. login) would not have been delivered.</p>
        <p>I am saddened by this, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.</p>
        <p>
            I am a tad disappointed in my team this sprint.<br>
            There was no transparency.<br>
            I learned that they were not going to deliver anything at the last minute and no one asked for help üôÅ.<br>
        </p>
        <p>I am very happy with my PO's (Jon) performance</p>
        <p>
            I am extremely happy with my SM's (Jordan) performance.<br>
            He took minutes.<br>
            He planned, specific time and location, the stand-ups ahead of time.<br>
            Made sure everyone was listening in on the stand-ups rather than just giving their report and then talking amongst themselves.<br>

<rubric-section :name="'Progress'">
    <div class="rubric-content">
        <p>I performed spectacularly this sprint.</p>
        <p>I delivered everything I committed to during the planning.</p>
        <p>I talked with my PO for the stories and their ACs.</p>
        <p>I fulfilled what I committed to and then some. I also unblocked my teammates wherever I could by giving them guides, articles, and documentation to read.</p>
        <p>
            During the last retrospective, we noted that the exception handling over HTTP could be better (see below image), and my stories this sprint addressed that completely.

            Here is the board from our sprint retrospective
            <img src="/images/sprint3_retrospective.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>In all honesty, none of the things in the "could be better" applies to me.</p>
        <p>
            I did TDD, I did not leave my stories for the last minute, I handle my exceptions, I test and ensure the quality of my tests, I give thorough reviews and request changes when necessary, and I try my damndest to be transparent and communicate with my team.
